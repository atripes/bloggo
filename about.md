## Developer at Brain&Heart.
Hi, I'm [Alex](https://github.com/atripes).
I was 6 when I first laid hands on a mouse fumbling around in MS paint (on Windows 3.1). Since then have been fascinated with computers.

I love to be part of a team. I am a member of the FSF. I try to avoid using Google, partly because I think that it's dangerous to rely on only one source of information and provide all sorts of information about oneself without being able to control that datastream, and partly because I think it's fun to deal with the challenge.

Trivia:
I have an International Certificate for operating sailboats up to 300 gross tons. I play the guitar. I have an education in opera singing. I take the bike whenever I can, I also build them myself. I love cooking. I played the lead role in the semi professionally produced musical Annie in 2012. I think the world would be a better place if programming (especially debugging) was taught in schools. I think, that being responsible for ones own actions is the greatest gift in life. I love refactoring. I like to use vim for every task it is suited for. This is true for all other pieces of software I use.
